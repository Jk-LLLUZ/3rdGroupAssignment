As of writing this paper, the world is in hiatus from fully experiencing the world outside their homes.  In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, part of mitigating infection is the limitation of physical interactions among human beings.  With that, one solution set by the governments across various nations is putting their countries in quarantine.  While this certainly helps prevent the spread of the virus, there are other accompanying deficiencies in this solution beyond the virus.  One of which is the rise in household utility bills such as electricity.  During the pandemic, Filipino families have relied on electrically powered appliances such as air conditioners, televisions, and the like for comfort and entertainment.  With that, they also result in higher, sometimes unprecedented, electricity charges.

<br>

Given this timely issue, solutions should be explored and implemented surrounding concepts of energy reduction and cost efficiency.  With that, the group came across an Indonesian academic article written by Martini et al. which tackles a simple yet impactful solution to  reducing the cost of electrical bills.  They identified that one of the most overlooked factors to heightened electricity bill prices is the constant usage of light bulbs and lamps.  Using fundamental concepts of electronics and programming, the researchers were able to test automatic light switches (sensor-based) against manual, traditional light switches in public restrooms as these are places wherein light is left on for long periods of time - therefore implying larger energy consumption and cost.
	
<br>

While Martini et al. provided various data in their study regarding the effectiveness of using a sensor in contrast to without using  a sensor, the group would like to determine its effectiveness over time.  This is part of the group’s quest to find whether using a sensor is a good long term solution to reducing energy consumption and cost.  With that, the group focused on two variables which are the energy consumption with a sensor (kWh), and the duration (hr) it is being observed over 7 hour intervals.  These number of observations amounted to 13 which also serves as the sample size of the study.

<br><br><br>



## Methodology
### **Methodology**

In this paper, an infrared-based sensor namely Passive Infrared Receiver or PIR (*refer to Figure 1*) is used to detect body movements present. Based on its name, PIR is a passive type of sensor meaning by itself, it does not emit infrared radiations. With this distinct quality, PIR is the suitable device to use in this study as the detected heat radiation is solely caused by human presence and body movements, creating a more controlled environment guaranteed from external errors.

<br>

With the goal to identify whether the sensors will decrease power consumption and consequently the cost, the Indonesian authors used the simplest way to obtain results. The plan was to compare the Electrical power consumed (in kWh) before and after the sensors’ installations. The experiment room to be used was a public restroom in their building, since restrooms are places where people come and go, making it an appropriate set-up for the experiment. The authors then installed the sensors on the electrical appliances —lamps and exhaust fans— (*refer to Figure 2*) to obtain a wide area of the room, and the Electrical Power Consumption Meter (*refer to Figure 3*) for the facilitation of data measurement. After measuring the power consumption every 7 hours for 13 times, the sensors and program were now activated and the second half of the reading and measuring proceeded.

<br>

We, the researchers, will conduct a hypothesis test and the next step would be identifying the parameters. The parameters to be calculated are the means and standard deviations of both variables. The sample of both variables are the same which is 13 and lastly, we will use a 5% confidence interval for this hypothesis test.

                  )

```

```{r, echo= FALSE}
  y <- c(1,	7,	14,	21,	28,	35,	42,	49,	56,	63, 70,	77,	84)
  x <- c(0.504,	2.711, 5.058,	7.158,	8.890,	10.622,	12.264,	13.816,	15.278,	16.651,	17.933,	19.126,	20.229)

```

#### Simple Linear Regression 

Given the set of x and y values, we can determine the simple linear regression model using the **least squares method.**  This method is best represented by the equation:

<center>
  $\hat{y}=\hat{\beta_0}+\hat{\beta_1}x$ <br><br>
</center>

It is worth taking note that this is **reminiscent of the slope intercept form** $y=mx+b$. <br><br>

With that, we would have to solve for the following values and summations at $n=13$: <br><br>

:::: {style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; grid-column-gap: 10px;"}

:::: {}

Summation of $x_i$
$$
  \sum_{i=1}^{13}{x_i}
$$
$$
  \sum_{i=1}^{13}{x_i}=150.24
$$
<br>
Mean of $x_i$

$$
  \bar{x_i}= \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{13}{x_i}}{n}
$$
$$
  \bar{x_i}= \frac{150.24}{13}
$$
$$
  \bar{x_i}= 11.55692308 \approx 11.56
$$

<br>

Summation of squares of $x_i$ 

$$
  \sum_{i=1}^{13}x_i^2
$$
$$
  \sum_{i=1}^{13}=2224.85229\approx2224.85
$$


:::

:::{}

Summation of $y_i$

$$
  \sum_{i=1}^{13}{y_i}
$$
$$
  \sum_{i=1}^{13}{y_i}=547
$$
<br>

Mean of $y_i$

$$
  \bar{y_i}= \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{13}{y_i}}{n}
$$
$$
  \bar{y_i}= \frac{547}{13}
$$
$$
  \bar{y_i}= 42.07692308 \approx 42.08
$$

<br>

Summation of squares of $y_i$
$$
  \sum_{i=1}^{13}y_i^2
$$
$$
  \sum_{i=1}^{13}=31,851
$$

:::

::::

Summation of $x_i$ times $y_i$

  $$
    \sum_{i = 1}^{13} x_i y_1
  $$
  $$
    \sum_{i = 1}^{13} =8385.202\approx8385.20
  $$



With these values solved for already, we may proceed to solving for $S_{xy}$ and $S_{xx}$ using the formulae below: <br><br>

**For $S_{xx}$**
$$
  S_{xx} = \sum_{i = 1}^{n} x_i^2 - \frac{(\sum_{i = 1}^{n} x_i)^2}{n}
$$

<br>**For $S_{xy}$**
$$
  S_{xy} = \sum_{i = 1}^{n} x_i y_i - \frac{(\sum_{i = 1}^{n} x_i)(\sum_{i = 1}^{n} y_i)}{n}
$$
Since the values have already been solved for, we proceed to substituting as follows:

**For $S_{xx}$**
$$
  S_{xx} = \sum_{i = 1}^{n} x_i^2 - \frac{(\sum_{i = 1}^{n} x_i)^2}{n}
$$
$$
  S_{xx} = 2224.85 - \frac{150.24^2}{13}
$$
$$
  S_{xx} = 488.5378769\approx488.54
$$

**For $S_{xy}$**

$$
  S_{xy} = 8385.20 - \frac{(150.24)(547)}{13}
$$
$$
  S_{xy} = 2,063.563077 \approx 2,063.56
$$
Now that both have been solved for, we can now **calculate the estimates for regression coefficients as follows:**

**For $\hat{\beta_1}$**
$$
  \hat{\beta_1}= \frac{S_{xy}}{S_{xx}}
$$
$$
  \hat{\beta_1}= \frac{2,063.563077}{448.5378769}
$$
$$
  \hat{\beta_1}= 4.223932534\approx4.224
$$

**For $\hat{\beta_0}$**
$$
  \hat{\beta_0}=\overline{y}-\hat{\beta_1} \overline{x}
$$
$$
  \hat{\beta_0}=42.07692308 - (4.223932534)(11.55692308)
$$
$$
  \hat{\beta_0}=-6.738740311\approx-6.739
$$
This leaves with the equation for the best fit line or **the fitted simple linear regression model:**

$$
  \hat{y}=4.223932534x--6.738740311
$$

### **Using the 7-Step Approach**

#### **Step 1: Parameter of Interest**
We are interested in $\mu_a$ and $\mu_b$, specifically the difference between the energy consumption in kilowatt hours of using the sensor and without the sensor. <br><br>


#### **Step 2: Stating Null Hypothesis**
The null hypothesis would be as follows $H_0 : \mu_A = \mu_b$ saying that there is no significant difference between the energy consumption with the sensor and without it.<br><br>

#### **Step 3: Stating Alternative Hypothesis**
The alternative hypothesis would be as follows $H_1 : \mu_A < \mu_B$ saying that the energy consumption without the sensor would be significantly greater than with the use of the sensor..<br><br>

#### **Step 4: Determining Appropriate Test Statistic**
Since the mean and standard deviation are known (refer to the Methodology section), and the sample is less than 30, then the appropriate test statistic is defined by the formula: 

$$
  t = \frac{\overline{x}_A-\overline{x}_B}{\sqrt{(\frac{s^2_A}{n_A}}+\frac{s^2_B}{n_B})}
$$
<br><br>

#### **Step 5: Reject $H_o$ if**
Reject $H_0$ if the p-value is less than $0.05$

<br><br>
*Calculating the Degree of Freedom*

$$
  D_f = \frac{((\frac{\sigma_a^2}{n_a})+(\frac{\sigma_b^2}{n_b}))^2}{\frac{(\frac{\sigma_a^2}{n_a})^2}{n_a-1}+\frac{(\frac{\sigma_b^2}{n_b})^2}{n_b-1}}
$$

$$
  D_f = \frac{((\frac{6.4^2}{13})+(\frac{18^2}{13}))^2}{\frac{(\frac{6.4^2}{13})^2}{12}+\frac{(\frac{18^2}{13})^2}{12}}
$$

$$
  D_f  = \frac{788.1408379}{0.8272788955+51.76331361}
$$

$$
  D_f  = 14.98634642
\\
  D_f  = 14.99
$$

<br><br>

#### **Step 6: Computations**

$$
 t = \frac{11.6-27.9}{\sqrt{(\frac{6.4^2}{13}}+\frac{18^2}{13})}
$$

$$
  t = -3.078356393
$$

<br> 

We then find the probability of $P(t\ge -3.08)$ by first determining the degrees of freedom which was done in step 5.  Then, we can proceed by using the R function: pt(t, df) to determine this probability then compare it to our level of significance which is $\alpha = 0.05$

```{r}
  pt(-3.078356393, 14.99)
```
<br>
Therefore, the **probability of $P(t\ge -3.08)$ is approximately 0.004.**<br><br>

#### **Step 7: Conclusion** 
Since  **0.004 is significantly less than 0.05**, we reject the null hypothesis. Therefore, we can come to a conclusion that the energy consumption without the use of a sensor is significantly greater than when using a sensor.

## Discussion and Conclution
### **Results**



Based on the result of the 7-Step approach, the **null hypothesis** was **rejected** as 0.0004 is significantly less than 0.05. With this, we can conclude that the energy usage without a sensor is substantially higher than when a sensor is used, proving the PIRs to be successful in lowering power consumption. Additionally, according to the results that were found during the testing and experiment, there were still insignificance in the first hours of cost savings. However, the savings had increased considerably to over 60% overtime after one week. Ultimately, it can be said that this method of reducing energy consumption and cost is effective.
